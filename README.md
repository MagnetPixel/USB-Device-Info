# USB_device_info
A little tool to read USB info and print it to console

Tested on Windows 10 64bit

The tool just prints all the USB devices in the Console

Compiled used MinGW on windows
(winlibs-x86_64-posix-seh-gcc-14.2.0-llvm-18.1.8-mingw-w64ucrt-12.0.0-r1)

Please share any improvements :)

# Idea behind the project
It started with the simple idea that I wanted to read as much information about the USB capabuilities in the machine.
This can be used in other projects. 

I dont know that much about the interface hence getting all the hardware spec. was a natural first step.
