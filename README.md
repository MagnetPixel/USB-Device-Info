# USB_device_info
A little tool to read USB info and print it to console

Tested on Windows 10 64bit, OSX 13.6.7

The tool just prints all the USB devices in the Console

Compiled used MinGW on windows
(winlibs-x86_64-posix-seh-gcc-14.2.0-llvm-18.1.8-mingw-w64ucrt-12.0.0-r1)

Please share any improvements :)

# Idea behind the project
It started with the simple idea that I wanted to read as much information about the USB capabuilities in the machine.

# Limitations
It does not give much info on Mac interfaces but it lists info on HUBs connected to the MAC...
